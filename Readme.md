# Assignment_003

## version 1

> As it is mentioned in Android O documentation: `ProgressDialog` class was deprecated in **API level 26**. `ProgressDialog` is a modal dialog, which prevents the user from interacting with the app. Instead of using this class, I use `ProgressBar`, embedded in my app's UI, to finish my assignment.

## Version 2

> As it is mentioned in [AsyncTask  | Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask), This class was deprecated in API level 30. The documentation recommends that developers should use  the standard `java.util.concurrent` or [Kotlin concurrency utilities](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines) instead.

Add the hint when meeting errors and some item decoration.
