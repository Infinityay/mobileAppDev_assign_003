# Assignment_003

## version 1

> As it is mentioned in Android O documentation: This class was deprecated in **API level 26**. `ProgressDialog` is a modal dialog, which prevents the user from interacting with the app. Instead of using this class, I use `ProgressBar`, embedded in my app's UI, to finish my assignments.
